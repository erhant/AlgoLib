This repository is a collection of algorithms I wrote for fun back in undergraduate days. I initially wrote the C# Library, under `C# Library`, but then I worked on WPF application for the same code, which is under `C# GUI` and then tried something similar for Java, under `Java GUI`.


Note from July 4, 2020: I thought I lost this code, but found it in a random drive laying around the house!
